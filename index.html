                    Jenni has worked with children, teens, and families for 25 years.  After practicing in pediatric primary care, she specialized in child maltreatment medicine for over a decade.  This sparked a passion for mental health and healing.  As her passion for mental health grew while practicing in a pediatric clinic, she chose to return to school to specialize in psychiatry as a psychiatric nurse practitioner.

                <p class="body">
                    My name is Jenni Griswold and I am a nurse practitioner dual certified in psychiatry and pediatrics.  My initial master's in nursing was through Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions in Boston.  It has been my privilege over the past 23 years to take care of children and adolescents in varying stages of health and illness.  I have worked in general pediatrics and specialized in child maltreatment medicine.
                    In doing this work, I came to deeply understand the lasting and complex impact of trauma, childhood or otherwise, on individual and societal health and wellness.  These varying experiences have grown a passion for mental health and wellness that inspired me to leave my pediatric practice and return to Gonzaga University to become a PMHNP.  I intend to develop a practice model that allows me to work in a holistic way with children, adolescents, and families in my community to enhance access and early intervention across all areas of mental health and wellness.
                    I am married and have three young adult children and a giant dog.  I love all the beauty and adventure that Central Oregon has to offer including hiking, running, cycling, and cross-country skiing.  I look forward to meeting you and seeing what we can do together.
